### Fraud detection examples

Recurly.js supports enhanced fraud detction based on customer device data. There are two examples
here.

If you are using the [Recurly fraud management](https://docs.recurly.com/v1.0/docs/fraud-management)
or [Kount direct fraud management](https://docs.recurly.com/v1.0/docs/kount) integrations,
see [this example](recurly-kount.html)

If you are using the Braintree fraud management integration, first be sure to familiarize yourself with
[their client-side data collector documentation](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/advanced-fraud-tools/client-side/javascript/v3),
then see [this example](braintree.html)
